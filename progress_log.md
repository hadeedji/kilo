# Progress log

- (4/9/2023) Finished 5 chapters out of 7, basic text editing is fully
possible. It has fun been working on this, but semester is starting now and I
might not get to work on this a lot anymore. It might have lots of bugs, and
there's lots of things I don't like, there are TODOs everywhere. So many leaky
abstractions, near the end I started blindly following the tutorial and didn't
stop to think how it fits with the abstractions I have defined, but I might fix
it all one of these days...

- (9/9/2023) Didn't implement any new features, but refactored heavily. All the
previous features should be working unless I introduced a bug. But I like the
abstractions better now, and I cleaned up most of TODOs. This was painful to
get right and I contemplated quitting, but proud of myself. I find it very
interesting that the total of amount of code barely changed, it actually
decreased as measured by tokei. It increased slightly in the header files and
decreased in the source files, yet it was a lot of work.
