# Progress log
- (4/9/2023) Finished 5 chapters out of 7, basic text editing is fully
  possible. It has fun been working on this, but semester is starting now and I
  might not get to work on this a lot anymore. It might have lots of bugs, and
  there's lots of things I don't like, there are TODOs everywhere.
